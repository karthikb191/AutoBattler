# AutoBattler
A deterministic simulation of battle between spheres!

#What's in it
- Simulation happens in Fixed Time Steps.
- An arena made of square tiles.
- Spheres are assigned to teams and are spawned on an arbitrary tile.
- Spheres move in simulation at a certain user specified tiles per Time Step.
- Attack and cooldown spans some user specified time frames
- Spheres dim down a little bit when hit
- If all spheres in one team dies, simulation restarts
